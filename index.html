<h1>keyto</h1>

<p>Simple application for getting information from plain-text i2p destination keys.
It's goal is to be short, understandable to anyone, and just do this one thing
in a reliable, easy to install way that doesn't even require an I2P router
installed to use.</p>

<h2>setup</h2>

<p>If you have go and git installed, you can just</p>

<pre><code>    go get -u github.com/eyedeekay/keyto
</code></pre>

<p>Or, you can use the binary by downloading and unzipping this file:
<a href="https://github.com/eyedeekay/keyto/archive/master.zip">keyto</a>, then running the
appropriate application for your OS and Platform. To install it into your PATH,
you can use:</p>

<pre><code>    make
</code></pre>

<p>to build it for your platform, and</p>

<pre><code>    sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>to install it to /usr/bin/</p>

<h2>use</h2>

<p>The first argument to keyto should be a full destination, in plain text format.
If you've got a file like local_dest.key from i2p-bote, you can redirect the
file into the first argument like so:</p>

<pre><code>    keyto $(cat local_dest.key)
</code></pre>
